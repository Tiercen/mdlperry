# Portfolio Website:

For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that youâ€™ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.

# Project Objectives:

Build a website using HTML, CSS
Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
Use Git version control
Use the command line and file navigation
Develop locally on your computer
Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages
OPTIONAL: [Buy a custom domain name](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/make-a-website/lessons/setting-up-your-domain/) and have it point to your GitHub Pages website

# Prerequisites:
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line and file navigation

# My Plan

I will be creating a very robust portfolio site that allows for easy updating when things change.  This will be accomplished by setting up most of the copy for this site inside a JSON file.  I envision this being extremely useful in sections for work history, life events, and hobbies or interests.

One of the objectives of this assignment is to use JavaScript to provide interactivity on the site from the user.  To do this I am going to prompt the user to select a theme for the site.  Professional or Personal. Selecting one will change the color and layout of the page as well as the information being displayed.  For instance: If you select professional you will see a very clean modern online resume detailing my current state and sharing work history and appropriate skills. If you select the personal theme you will see a heavily artistically styled site detailing my personal life sharing life events, hobbies, and current things I am working on.  Like building up my full stack development skill.
